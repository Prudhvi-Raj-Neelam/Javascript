1.Variables
-----------
In Programming,we use a variable to store data temporarily in a computer memory.
Ex:     let name = 'Mark';
        console.log(name);
        
  Naming rules:
  >Variable name cannot be a reserved keyword.
  >should be meaningful.
  >cannot start with a number.
  >cannot contain a space or hyphen(-).
  >Are Case-sensitive.
  
 
2.Constants
-------------
The value of a constant cannot change.
Ex:     const interestRate = 0.3;
        interestRate = 1;                   ///// Error
        console.log(interestRate);
        
 The difference between let and const variable is,In let we can reassign values but in const we cannot reassign value.
 
 3.Primitive Types
 ------------------
 Basically in JavaScript we have 2 categories of data types.
 (i)Primitives/Value Types        (ii) Reference Types
      String                          Object
      Number                          Array
      Boolean                         Function      
      Undefined
      null
 Ex:
      let name = 'Mark';
      let age = 30;
      let isApproved = true;
      let firstName;
      let selectedColors = null;
      
  4.Dynamic Typing
  ------------------
  The type of a variable can change at run time.
  
  Ex:   let name = 'Mark';
        console.log(name);
        
        name = 1;
        console.log(name);
        
  5.Objects
  -------------------
  An object in JavaScript is like an object in real life.
